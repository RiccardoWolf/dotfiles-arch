## Info
This is project to manage the dotfiles of my Arch setup for the packages indicated below.
Some scripts also helps you configuring those packages or other linux settings.

> **WARNING**  
> The script uses Stow to distribute the dotfiles into the system, DELETING ALREADY EXISTING FILES.
> Stow create symlinks so some packages or operations may have a problem with that.
