## Info
Dotfile for my Arch Hyprland setup managed by [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/)
Some scripts also helps you configuring those packages or other linux settings.

> **WARNING**  
> The script uses Stow to distribute the dotfiles into the system, DELETING ALREADY EXISTING FILES.
> Stow create symlinks so some packages or operations might have a problem with that.
